            <li class="gb">Global warming:-</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Global warming is the long-term warming of the planet’s overall temperature. Though this warming trend has been going on for a long time, its pace has significantly increased in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. As the human population has increased, so has the volume of fossil fuels burned. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, and burning them causes what is known as the “greenhouse effect” in Earth’s atmosphere.</li>
                <li>The greenhouse effect is when the sun’s rays penetrate the atmosphere, but when that heat is reflected off the surface cannot escape back into space. Gases produced by the burning of fossil fuels prevent the heat from leaving the atmosphere. These greenhouse gasses are carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, water vapor, methane, and nitrous oxide. The excess heat in the atmosphere has caused the average global temperature to rise overtime, otherwise known as global warming.</li>
                <li>Due to this our ozone layer got depleted and as a protecting layer got damged and harmful rays of the sun effect biodiversity directly.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre></pre>
            <li class="tp">Thermal powerplants:-</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In addition to power plants, other industrial facilities—such as petroleum refineries, pulp and paper mills, chemical plants, and steel mills—contribute to thermal pollution. They also use water to cool machinery and discharge water at elevated temperatures. </li>
                <li>This process of sucking in water from a lake, ocean, or river for industrial purposes and then releasing heated water back to its source is called once-through cooling. It has long been known to adversely affect aquatic and marine environments. Because of once-through cooling, fish and larvae that get trapped against intake screens are killed, and habitats are altered due to the discharge of warmer, often polluted water.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre></pre>
            <li class="hf">Hunting of animals:-</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Fishing and hunting are the removal of animals from ecosystems by humans for food and/ or sport. Some species are hunted because they are thought to be a threat to human life or livestock or have medicinal uses. Over the last 100 years, human population growth combined with innovations that help humans to locate and catch large numbers of organisms have resulted in dramatic decreases in many species populations worldwide, including many fish, whales, and large land mammals.</li>
                <li>Frugivores — such as fruit-eating birds, bats, primates, and deer — are widely hunted across the tropics. Many of these hunted animals perform important ecological functions that help maintain tree diversity, including seed dispersal, or movement of seeds away from the parent plants. Hunting can disrupt these ecological functions with dramatic consequences for forest trees.</li>
                <li>When frugivores are hunted out, seeds are not dispersed and instead gather only close to parents and to one another. Theoretically this decreases the survival of individual seeds and may eventually reduce populations of tree species. But whether reduced dispersal actually increased extinction risk of long-lived tree species.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre></pre>
            <li class="ww">Wastage of water:-</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Water wastage has several adverse effects, including environmental, economic, and social impacts. Environmentally, water wastage contributes to water scarcity, depletion of natural resources, and damage to aquatic life and ecosystems. Economically, it leads to increased water bills and costs, loss of revenue for businesses, and decreased agricultural production. Socially, water wastage causes the inequitable distribution of water resources, health risks, and limited access to education and employment opportunities. To address these problems, it is crucial to conserve water and ensure its sustainable use.</li>

            <pre></pre>
            <li class="err">Excess use of non renewable resources:-</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Non-renewable energy resources release harmful greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, creating the greenhouse effect which causes global warming. </li>    
            <li>Non-renewable energy sources are also harmful pollutants and lead to habitat destruction.</li>
            <li>As they are non renewable rescources we have to use them in limited amount otherwise they will gets over and will take long and long years to generate again.</li>
